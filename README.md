This is a personal website to have an online hub that you can link to all my projects, social media sites, and your resume.

This website idea was in collaboration with CTP Cohort 10, and was one of their summer hw assignments.

I built the website using Github pages, and HTML coding language. Please visit the website at: ii2Chris.github.io
and view all of my projects and social media links!
