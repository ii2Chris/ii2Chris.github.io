This is a personal website with an online hub that you can link to all my projects, social media sites, and your resume.

This website idea was in collaboration with CTP Cohort 10 and was one of their summer hw assignments.

I built the website using HTML and CSS, this is my first time creating one. Please visit the website at: ii2Chris.github.io
and view all of my projects and social media links!

I took inspiration from this website: https://brittanychiang.com/
