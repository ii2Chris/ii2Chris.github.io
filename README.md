This is a personal website with an online hub that I can link to all my projects, social media sites, and my resume.

This website idea was in collaboration with CTP Cohort 10 and was one of their summer hw assignments.

I built the website using HTML and CSS, this is my first time creating a site. I can say that I have learnt alot about HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br><br>

Please visit the website at: <p><a href="ii2Chris.github.io" target="_blank"> My Site</a> If the link isnt working, the site is: ii2Chris.github.io</p>
