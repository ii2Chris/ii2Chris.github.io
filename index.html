                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Christopher Budhram, and I am a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate. I am entering my senior year of college as I make this website, and it has been a long journey. I stumbled into the rabbit hole of coding during my final year of high school and the covid lockdown which helped push me into the direciton I am at now. Fast-fowarding to today, I have had countless experiences building software for myself and exploring this tech space.</p>
                <p>A fun fact about me is that I dont really like nature. Everyone I talk to seems to love nature or just being around it. But for me, it gives me a sense of lingering bordem, maybe because I have grown up in one of the busiest cities all my life, New York. It makes it hard to take a second and wind-down.</p>

                        <p>I developed a secure login and registration system in C++ that includes user authentication, error handling, and data encryption. This project introduced me to file handling and security protocols, ensuring the integrity and privacy of user data.</p>

                    <li> <h4>Financial Management System (Unfinished)</h4>
                        <p>I developed a financial management system in C++ that helps people track their expenses, manage their budgets, and get detailed financial reports automatically. This project really let me dive into object-oriented programming, which was a main focus of my education at the time.</p>
