                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Christopher Budhram, and I am a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate. I am entering my senior year of college as I make this website, and it has been a long journey. I stumbled into the rabbit hole of coding during my final year of high school and the covid lockdown which helped push me into the direciton I am at now. Fast-fowarding to today, I have had countless experiences building software for myself and exploring this tech space.</p>
                <p>A fun fact about me is that I dont really like nature. Everyone I talk to seems to love nature or just being around it. But for me, it gives me a sense of lingering bordem, maybe because I have grown up in one of the busiest cities all my life, New York. It makes it hard to take a second and wind-down.</p>
